In this section we will describe the different reports that can be
generated with PHP_Depend. These reports vary from machine readable
XML files, that contain highly detailed information about several
quality aspects of the analyzed project, to human readable
visualizations, that provide a very abstract view of the project's
code quality.

The human readable reports are very useful to detect design or quality
faults in an application, and they are a good indicator if the overall
quality trend is getting positive or negative. They can also assist you
to get quickly a better overview on a new, unknown software system. On
the other site the machine readable are good candidates for a *continuous
integration* system or other reporting tools, where custom reports can be
generated from the detailed data or an alert is triggered when a quality
metric exceeds a configured threshold.
