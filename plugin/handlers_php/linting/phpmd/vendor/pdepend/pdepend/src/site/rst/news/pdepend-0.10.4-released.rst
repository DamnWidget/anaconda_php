We are proud to announce that version `0.10.4`__ of PHP_Depend was released 
on April the 09th 2011. This release contains an improvement in PHP_Depend's
memory consumption. We have optimized the internal data structures in such a
way that the memory footprint was reduced by ~30%. These values were measured
for currently popular frameworks with a medium to large sized code base. The
tests were run under ubuntu with PHP 5.2.17 and PHP 5.3.6.
