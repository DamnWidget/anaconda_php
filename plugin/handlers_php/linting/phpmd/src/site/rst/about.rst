PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector
=========================

This is the project site of *PHPMD*. It is a spin-off project of
`PHP Depend`__ and aims to be a PHP equivalent of the well known
Java tool `PMD`__. PHPMD can be seen as an user friendly and easy
to configure frontend for the raw metrics measured by PHP Depend.

What PHPMD does is: It takes a given PHP source code base and look 
for several potential problems within that source. These problems
can be things like:

- Possible bugs
- Suboptimal code
- Overcomplicated expressions
- Unused parameters, methods, properties

PHPMD is a young project and so it only provides a limited set of
pre defined rules, compared with it's brother PMD, that detect code
smells and possible errors within the analyzed source code. Checkout
the `rules section`__ to learn more about all implemented rules.
